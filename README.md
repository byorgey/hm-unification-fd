A toy example showing how to implement Hindley-Milner type inference
using the [`unification-fd`
library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unification%2Dfd).

The code is a literate Haskell document which was [published as a blog
post](XXX).

To build it yourself, just clone the repo and do `stack run`.

Comments, suggestions for improvement, bug fixes, typo fixes, etc. are
all most welcome!
